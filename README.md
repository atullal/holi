## Design Principles

Holi adheres to the following design principles:

1. **Color Harmony**: The theme utilizes a carefully curated color palette that combines complementary and analogous hues, creating a visually appealing and cohesive experience.

2. **Readability**: While embracing vibrant colors, Holi ensures that text remains legible and comfortable to read, preventing eye strain during extended note-taking sessions.

3. **Aesthetic Delight**: Holi's design incorporates playful elements and subtle animations, adding a touch of whimsy and delight to the user experience.

4. **Customization**: The theme offers various customization options, allowing users to tailor the appearance to their personal preferences and workflow requirements.

5. **Typography**: Holi uses the [PP Fragment](https://pangrampangram.com/products/fragment) font family, a modern and expressive typeface that complements the theme's vibrant color palette.

## Promoting Creativity

Holi is designed to promote creativity in several ways:

- **Vibrant Colors**: The vivid color palette is intended to spark inspiration and encourage creative expression, making it easier to visualize and explore ideas.

- **Minimalist Design**: The clean and uncluttered interface reduces visual distractions, allowing users to focus on their thoughts and ideas without unnecessary distractions.

- **Expressive Elements**: The theme incorporates subtle animations and playful elements, fostering a sense of joy and encouraging users to embrace their creative side.

- **Flexible Customization**: By providing customization options, Holi empowers users to personalize their note-taking environment, aligning it with their unique creative processes and preferences.
